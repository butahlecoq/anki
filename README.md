# Kiroku

Kiroku is a private, offline-first Japanese flashcard workspace. The project is building toward an Anki-capable editor on Windows and an installable iPhone PWA that keeps studying available when both the PC and internet are offline.

The current release is the production PWA shell from [Issue #2](https://github.com/butahlecoq/anki/issues/2). Collection and review behavior is tracked by subsequent tickets; the interface does not pretend those features exist yet.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm 11 or newer

No Mac, Apple Developer membership, or paid service is required.

## Run locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints. Development mode listens on the local network so another device can connect when the host firewall and secure-context requirements are satisfied.

## Run the production build

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` type-checks and builds the application before serving it at `http://localhost:4173`. Localhost is suitable for desktop verification. Installing the PWA on an iPhone will require trusted HTTPS; that production deployment is tracked by [Issue #24](https://github.com/butahlecoq/anki/issues/24).

## Verify

Install the Playwright browser engines once:

```powershell
npx playwright install chromium webkit
```

Run every current check:

```powershell
npm run check
```

The browser suite builds the production app, starts it locally, then verifies desktop Chromium and phone-sized WebKit. It includes a service-worker-backed offline cold reload rather than testing only a warm page.

## Privacy

Imported packages, Anki databases, media, runtime data, backups, environment secrets, and generated certificates are ignored by Git. Do not commit a real collection or identity-bearing fixture.

## Agent collaboration

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before claiming a ticket. Each agent must claim one unblocked GitHub issue and use its own branch and worktree; agents must not edit the same working directory.
